# copyright-garbage.yml — lean, shape-based filters
# Strategy:
# - Keep a few safe literals.
# - Use anchored regexes for boilerplate, empty © lines, and noisy "(c) ..." junk.
# - Avoid matching lines that include a likely owner name.

garbage:
  literals:
    # Very safe, generic boilerplate phrases (these alone aren't useful findings).
    - "All rights reserved."
    - "Auto-generated file"
    - "This file is generated"
    - "Do not edit"
    - "Generated by"
    - "SPDX-License-Identifier"   # just the key; we keep the value via regex below too

  regex:
    # 1) Bare year or © year with NO owner (common noise)
    - "^\\s*(?:©|\\(c\\)|Copyright)\\s*(?:\\(c\\)\\s*)?(?:19|20)\\d{2}(?:\\s*[-–]\\s*(?:19|20)\\d{2})?\\s*$"

    # 2) SPDX tag line alone (license id on the same line, no owner)
    - "^\\s*SPDX-License-Identifier:\\s*\\S+\\s*$"

    # 3) Generic generated-file banners
    - "^\\s*(?:This file (?:is )?(?:auto-)?generated|Generated by)\\b.*$"

    # 4) Lines containing NUL or obvious binary junk
    - ".*\\x00.*"

    # 5) ‘(c)’ followed only by punctuation/symbols/digits (no words/owner)
    #    - allow short words like 'INC' or names to pass through
    - "^\\s*\\(c\\)\\s*(?:[\\p{P}\\p{S}\\d\\s]|https?://\\S+){10,}$"

    # 6) ‘(c)’ + code fragments where there’s clearly no owner (common in minified JS)
    - "^\\s*\\(c\\)\\s*[,;:{}()\\[\\]|&!/*+=<>\\-\\.\\w\\s]{20,}$"

    # 7) Plain ‘Copyright’ alone or followed by only punctuation (no owner)
    - "^\\s*Copyright\\s*[\\p{P}\\s]*$"

    # 8) Year only (no ©/Copyright), standalone line
    - "^\\s*(?:19|20)\\d{2}(?:\\s*[-–]\\s*(?:19|20)\\d{2})?\\s*$"

    # 9) StackOverflow question pages (keep your original, anchored and specific)
    - "^\\(c\\) https?://stackoverflow\\.com/questions/.+$"

    # 10) Pure URL lines beginning with (c) (lots of your literals were exactly this)
    - "^\\s*\\(c\\)\\s+https?://\\S+\\s*$"
