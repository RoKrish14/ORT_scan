SWE3 Output Encoding & Escaping: Design Review Questions
Is all output that includes user-controlled data encoded or escaped according to the context in which it's displayed (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS, XML)?

Are context-aware encoding functions used to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks?

Is automatic escaping enabled and correctly configured in templating engines?

Are instances of raw HTML/JavaScript injection (e.g., "innerHTML" or "eval" equivalents) reviewed and justified?

Is user-supplied content sanitized before being displayed, even after encoding, to mitigate potential complex attacks?

Are HTTP headers that contain user-supplied data properly encoded to prevent header injection?

Is there protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens or mechanisms on state-changing requests?

Are clickjacking mitigations in place (e.g., X-Frame-Options, Content Security Policy frame-ancestors)?

Is Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented to mitigate XSS and other content injection attacks?

Are cookies secured with HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite attributes where appropriate?
