# license-classifications.yml — ORT-compatible (only categories + categorizations)
# Policy highlights:
# - permissive, public-domain, copyleft, copyleft-limited = handled by rules.kts
# - restricted = warning bucket (JSON, BSL-1.0, all Creative Commons except CC0, WTFPL, Artistic-1.0)
# - forbidden = hard-ban (still shows as “unhandled” error with current rules.kts)
# - copyleft-network = AGPL family
